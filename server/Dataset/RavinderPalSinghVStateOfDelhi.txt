Sat Pal, J.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner has referred to Section 219 of the Cr.P.C. and submits that since all the offences are alleged to have been committed within one year, the accused should be charged with and tried at one trial. He, therefore, submits that instead of furnishing 3 sureties the accused should be directed to furnish one surety. I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and I order that the accused be released on bail on furnishing personal bonds in the sum of Rs. 5,000 in each case with one surety of Rs. 5,000 for all the three cases. With this order the petition stands disposed of. The petitioner, who is in Jail may be, informed accordingly.
